<!-- for corousel -->

absolute inset-0 → positions overlay and text across the whole slide.

bg-black/50 → dark semi-transparent layer for readability.

flex items-center justify-center text-center → centers your text nicely.

Added mt-4 / mt-6 for spacing between heading, paragraph, and badges.


<!-- For text gradient -->

bg-gradient-to-r → creates a gradient background (orange → green).

bg-clip-text → clips that background to the text shape.

text-transparent → hides the text color so gradient shows through.

You still control size with text-3xl md:text-4xl.
